 📄 Project Overview

This repository accompanies the MSc dissertation titled:

"Impact of Image Compression and Format Conversion on Fingerprint Recognition: Exploring Security and Performance Trade-Offs"

The project investigates how various image compression formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, WebP) and compression levels (20%, 60%) affect fingerprint recognition system performance using key biometric metrics such as:

- False Acceptance Rate (FAR)  
- False Rejection Rate (FRR)  
- Equal Error Rate (EER)

The analysis used the Neurotechnology VeriFinger SDK to assess biometric accuracy across high- and low-quality fingerprint datasets.

⚙️ Tools Used

- Neurotechnology VeriFinger SDK: For fingerprint matching and biometric performance evaluation.
- Microsoft Visual Studio: For managing preprocessing tasks and SDK integration.
- Standard image manipulation tools: For format conversion and compression.

❗ No Source Code

> This project did not involve custom source code development. All experimentation was conducted using third-party SDKs and pre-existing image datasets.
